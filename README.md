# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
An obstacle-avoiding robot project involves designing and constructing a robotic car capable of automatically navigating through an environment while avoiding obstacles in its path. Typically, such a robot is equipped with sensors, such as ultrasonic sensors, to detect obstacles and determine their proximity.

## Abstract
The obstacle-avoiding robot project focuses on the development of an autonomous robotic car capable of intelligently navigating its surroundings while evading obstacles. Essential to this project is the integration of sensors, particularly ultrasonic sensors, which enable the robot to detect obstacles and dynamically adjust its path to avoid collisions.
